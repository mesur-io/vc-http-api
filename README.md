## vc-http-api

The VC HTTP API repository contains a standard API specification for constructing and verifying objects which conform to the [Verifiable Credential Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) specification, along with documentation, integration and compatability tests, and related assets.

#### Structure

The vc-http-api repository is structured with two main sections:

- [docs](./docs/) which contains the VC HTTP API spec itself in [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) form as well as related documentation to assist in building and testing a compliant implementaiton of the API spec
- [packages](./packages/) which contains test suites and related utilities for integration testing, test suite results, and related assets.

#### Contributing

We encourage contributions meeting the [Contribution
Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).  While we prefer the creation of issues
and Pull Requests in the GitHub repository, discussions often occur
on the
[public-credentials](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/)
mailing list as well.
